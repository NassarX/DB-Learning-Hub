****Before the Advent of Databases****

One way to keep information on a computer is to store it in permanent files (file-based system).

- **Disadvantages of File-based system**
    - Data redundancy
    - Data inconsistency
    - Difficult data access
    - Security problems
    - Difficult concurrent access

**What is a database?**

>A database is a shared collection of related**data**. By**data,** we mean known facts that can be recorded and that have implicit meaning.

**What is DBMS?**

>DBMS is a collection of programs that enable the users of the organization to create and maintain databases and control all access to them, with a primary goal to provide an environment that is both convenient and efficient for users to retrieve and store information.

****Benefits of using the database approach****

1. Control of data redundancy (**data normalization**)
2. Data sharing
3. Enforcement of integrity constraints
4. Restriction of unauthorized access
5. Backup and recovery facilities
