Welcome to retail chains RDBMS project! 

>A Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) build for retails chain stores as a part of **`Storing and Retrieving Data`**  course - [MDSAA-DS](https://www.novaims.unl.pt/MDSAA-DS) - Fall 2022

### A brief details of the Project

A chain store or retail chain is a retail outlet in which several locations share a brand, 
central management and standardized business practices.
In retail, dining, and many service categories, chain businesses have come to dominate the market in many parts of the
world. Almost all these chain businesses use sophisticated software and database systems to
improve efficiency and increase sales.   
This project aims to develop a database management system for such a chain business sys-
tem, particularly for this project a supermarket chain business, keeping record and transactions
of each store in the chain and handle changes due to supplies.
